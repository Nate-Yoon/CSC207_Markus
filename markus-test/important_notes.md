Throughout the term, you will submit some of your work on MarkUsLinks to an external site..

- For each assignment, you will need to go to its assignment page on MarkUs and either:
  - Option 1 Press the "Add Starter Files to Repository" button to tell MarkUs to commit the files to your remote repository — you can then either reclone your repo or pull these changes into your previously cloned repo.
  - Option 2 Download the starter files and manually copy them into your local repo — then add, commit, and push as usual.
- Once you clone this project in IntelliJ, you can submit files by adding, committing, and pushing them, exactly as you did during the Fizz Buzz activity.

testing please work
